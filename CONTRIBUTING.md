## Instructions

- Fork the repo
- Clone it and install dependencies

Make and commit your changes. Make sure the commands npm run build and npm run test:prod are working.

Finally send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more [about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
